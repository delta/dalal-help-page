# Greetings!

Welcome to Dalal Street a virtual stock trading game as a part of (Pragyan)[https://pragyan.org].

## Getting Started

- The core objective of the game is to maximize your net worth. This can be done in a number of ways including
    1. Buying stocks at a low price and selling them at a higher price.
    2. Short selling stocks at a low price and buying it back when the price is lower.

- There are 3 types of transactions which you can use to buy stocks ```Market Order```, ```Limit Order```, ```Stoploss Order```. We will look about each order in depth later. You can also checkout the [FAQ section](/faq#help-i-dont-know-what-market-limit-and-stoploss-orders-are) to know more about them.

- Other than this, the user also has the option to buy the stocks directly from the exchange.
