# Actions Against Malpractice

If a user is found guilty of any form of malpractice,including but not limited to, **having multiple accounts, performing cash funnelling operations between the accounts and any other form of embezzlement**, the user will be blocked for the day, as a warning for violating the Code of Conduct. If the user is still found to be continuing with malpractice, then the user will be blocked from playing for the entire duration of the game.
