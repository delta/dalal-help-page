# How short selling works


- there will be a fixed number of stocks available for shorting which will be lend to users to place sell orders

- When a user tries to sell a stock which he / she does not own, the stock is borrowed from the ```Lender```. 

- At the end of the day when the market closes, the market is squared off and the lent stock worth is deducted from the user's net worth.
